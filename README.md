# Udacity-Dog-Breed-Project

The Jupyter-Notebook-File [dog_app.ipynb](dog_app.ipynb) includes my
solution to the Dog-Breed-Classifier-Project in the Deeplearning-Nanodegree. 

## General Description

An algorithm with the following functionality is implemented: Given an arbitrary 
image it first decides if a human or a dog or neither of the two is shown. If the
image shows a dog it then detects the breed of the shown dog. If it shows a person
the algorithm outputs the most resembling dog breed.
